# Scenario
 
You are a recent computing graduate and you are applying for a graduate software developer position at a new technology consultancy company. As part of the interview process, you have to demonstrate a range of your technical programming skills.


**A typical user interaction is listed below:**


The program starts by prompting the user with some menu choices, asking the user if they would like to enter grades for a student, view student grades or exit the program.

A user selects they want to enter grades for a student and they start by entering a student name and then a student number. The student number is in the format of a 9 digit number. The user must now enter 6 different module marks separately and these marks must fall within the range of 0 -100. Any lower or higher values must not be accepted. Once the marks are entered, a grade average is calculated. If the grade average is equal to 40 or higher, then the student has passed, otherwise they have failed. This data is saved to a text file with the filename being the student number. 

The user is now prompted with the menu choices again, and this time they select to view a studentâ€™s marks. They enter a student number and are presented with the marks for the 6 modules for that student, and a message to say if they have passed or failed. 

The user is presented with the menu choices again and this time they decide to quit the program. 

**This console application demonstrates the successful use of:**

* Data types and variables
* Sequence programming
* Conditional statements
* Loops and repetition
* Calculation
* Methods
* Data persistence (Writing data to, and reading data from a file)
* Data structures and arrays
