# Scenario
 
You have recently been employed as a Junior Software Developer for a tech company and you have been given your first individual project to complete. Your company have tasked you with creating an Object Oriented C# computer program for a new high street bank.


**A typical user interaction is listed below:**


The program starts by prompting the user with some menu choices, asking the user if they would like to create a new account, withdraw from an existing account, deposit to an existing account, check balance or quit the program.

The user selects that they would like to create a new account. This system generates a new, unique, account number and then asks them for the account holder’s name and how much the account’s opening balance will be. The account’s opening balance is validated to ensure that the user’s entry is valid and that a positive amount is entered. The user is prompted with a confirmation and then returned to the menu.  

The user is now prompted with the menu choices again, and this time they select to make a deposit. The system prompts the user to enter an account number. Once the account number is entered, the system will search for the correct account. If the account exists, the user can enter an amount that they would like to deposit. This will then be added to the existing total. If the account doesn’t exist, the user will be notified and be returned to the menu. 

The user is now prompted with the menu choices again, and this time they select to make a withdrawal. The system prompts the user to enter an account number. Once the account number is entered, the system will search for the correct account. If the account exists, the user can enter an amount that they would like to withdraw. If the account contains enough money, the withdrawal can go ahead and the new total will be saved, otherwise an error needs to be displayed alerting the user, and the user is given another chance to enter an amount to withdraw. If the account doesn’t exist, the user will be notified and be returned to the menu. 

The user is now prompted with the menu choices again and this time they select to view a balance. The user inputs an account number. If the account exists then the user will see the current balance in the account. If the account does not exist then the user will see an error and be returned to the menu.

The user is presented with the menu choices again and this time they decide to quit the program.
